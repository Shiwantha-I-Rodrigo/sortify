# SORTING ALGORITHMS

Following is a comprehensive list of sorting algorithms in use,\
the list will be updated to indicate as the algorithms that are being implemented,

## Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms:
Compare elements and swap them based on comparisons.

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Tim Sort
- Shell Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Odd-Even Sort
- Comb Sort
- Pancake Sort
- Library Sort
- Tree Sort
- Radix Sort (LSD and MSD)

## Non-Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms:
Leveraging the range of input values or the number of digits.

- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort
- Flash Sort

## Hybrid Sorting Algorithms:
Combine the advantages of multiple sorting techniques to optimize performance for specific data.

- Tim Sort (Merge Sort + Insertion Sort)
- Intro Sort (Quick Sort + Heap Sort + Insertion Sort)

## Parallel and Distributed Sorting Algorithms:
Designed for parallel or distributed computing systems.

- Bitonic Sort
- Sample Sort
- Odd-Even Merging Sort

## External Sorting Algorithms:
For large datasets that do not fit into memory and need to be sorted using external storage.

- External Merge Sort
- Replacement Selection Sort
